problem identified:

12/01
when we use that hash funcion in pbkf2 or whatever, that function has a limiter ig, which limits the number of characters in the 
password
due to which, when i try to hash the weightedString, it shows an error
and this persists for all versions ie, base64 or else
i tried the hash using smaller strings, hashing and verification works
so, problem has to be with our weights
